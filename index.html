                <h1>Sample Walkthrough</h1>
                <p>Welcome to our smart contract code analysis walkthrough! In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how our two-stage LLM-powered system can help you ensure the reliability and security of your smart contracts.</p>
                <p>Our system utilizes LLMs as both auditors and critics, providing a comprehensive analysis of your code. It identifies potential security risks and suggests improvements, maximizing the detection of true vulnerabilities while minimizing false positives.</p>
                <p>By leveraging the power of LLMs, you can trust that your smart contracts are robust and secure. Our walkthrough will guide you through the process of uploading your smart contract code and analyzing it using our LLM-powered system.</p>
                <p>Throughout the walkthrough, we will highlight the key features and benefits of our system, showcasing its effectiveness in identifying vulnerabilities and providing actionable insights. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, this tutorial will help you understand the importance of code analysis and how LLMs can enhance the security of your smart contracts.</p>

The approve function does not handle the scenario where the spender already has an existing allowance approved by the owner, allowing the spender to overwrite the approval with any value. This could lead to unintended bypassing of restrictions set by the owner. The correctness of this vulnerability is high as the approval overwrite scenario is clearly present. The severity is moderate as it can lead to unauthorized fund transfers. The profitability is also moderate as an attacker could exploit this to gain access to more tokens than intended.",

                <h1>Conclusion</h1>
                <p>This walkthrough has illustrated the flow from the input of smart contract code to the detailed output from the auditor and critic agents. This system leverages the strengths of LLMs to provide a comprehensive and reliable method for detecting vulnerabilities in smart contracts.</p>
                <p>By using the Auditor, you can identify potential vulnerabilities in your smart contract code. The Auditor analyzes the code and generates a JSON file that contains detailed information about each identified vulnerability. This file includes the function name, vulnerability description, and an explanation of why the code is considered vulnerable.</p>
                <p>After running the Auditor, you can then use the Critic to evaluate each identified vulnerability based on predefined criteria such as correctness, severity, and exploitability. The Critic generates a JSON file that provides a detailed analysis of each vulnerability, including a critic, scores for correctness, severity, and profitability.</p>
                <p>With the output files from the Auditor and Critic, you have a comprehensive understanding of the vulnerabilities in your smart contract code. You can use this information to prioritize and address the identified vulnerabilities, ensuring the security and integrity of your smart contract.</p>
                <p>Remember to regularly audit and critic your smart contract code to stay proactive in identifying and addressing potential vulnerabilities.</p>
